# migovec-resurvey-project
A project for migrating the Migovec Survey Data to Therion.

The repository contains survey data from the 40km+ Tolminski Migovec cave system, located in NW Slovenia.

This survey data was collected between the year 1974-2018 by Imperial College Caving Club (ICCC) and Jamarska Sekcija Planinskega Drustva Tolmin (JSPDT).

To contribute to the project, please refer to the relevant ICCC wiki entry which details how to add new cave onto the existing survey.
