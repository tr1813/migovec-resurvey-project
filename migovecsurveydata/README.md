# Survey data

These files are the survey data resulting from explorations of the
caves on the Migovec Plateau, Slovenia by JSPDT and Imperial 
College Caving club over the years 1994-2007.
It is copyright 1994-2007 Imperial College Union Caving Club

The data is in survex format. You can get the latest version of
survex from www.survex.com and it runs on most platforms. Since
all the data is in ascii format, it can also be ported into other
survey programs. All data is in tape - compass - clino form.

The file 'entrances' gives the IAS location of cave entrances. The
IAS position is in units of 10m. Some of the locations where 
located on a 1:10,000 map. The rest were taken from the survex .pos
file, and are therefore consistent with the underground survey.


## Running 

`cavern mig.svx`
will compile the whole survey. Individual caves can be compiled by
running `cavern` on their respective files.

`mig.svx`: all caves on mig  
`system_migovec.svx`: all caves connected into System Migovec (M2, M16, M18, Vrtnarija, Primadonna, Monatip)  

Others are just the entrances listed seperated by an underscore.


## 2008 Notes:
The survey is still tied into the above 1:10'000 IAS coordinates.
Though GPS should today offer more accuracy, the alignment of GPS
Latitude and Longtitude with the local grid is still unclear and 
errorprone.

The data should hopefully be improved to reflect the three-system 
nature of the mountain, and allow a more modular selection of cave 
passage to display.
